This is a framework I built in response to my lack of satisfaction with other PHP frameworks. It's designed to be small, but mostly clean and dynamic.

Namely that sometimes you need to structure your code in a certain way against convention in order to produce the most elegant solution. This is an MVC framework that aims to make that as easy as possible.
